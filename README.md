- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adrian, 20 yrs old self-taught programmer, currently enrolled in University of Technology in Warsaw on Computer Science course.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mainly interested in back-end - mostly doing some stuff in Java (spring-boot), however I've got some basics of front-end (html, css, js, react).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java (spring-boot), C (for university projects etc.). Looking forward to start learning Kotlin in a near future.
